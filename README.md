By default I have set Volume widget to a fixed position. If the position I have chosen does not work for you, then look at the code and change the coordinates. As always, the code is commented and easy to follow.  I have also set Volume widget to ignore the close event. ALT+F4 will not work by default.  If you need that functionality then comment out these lines

#Ignore ALT+F4. We want to avoid accidental closing. </br>
def closeEvent(self, event): </br>
event.ignore()

Executing:

After downloading, decompress the archive and cd into the resulted  directory.

If needed, make files executable:

chmod +x filename.py

OR

chmod +x filename.sh

Run with: python filename_location.py
